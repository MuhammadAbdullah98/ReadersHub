                        <h4>How to Build Skills That Are Valuable</h4>
                        <span><p>In the early 1940s, a young boy was growing up in the small county of Almhult in southern Sweden. Within a few years, he would impact millions of people. At the time, however, nobody knew his name.

                            The boy was occupied with a small and relatively simple project. He had recently discovered that it was possible to buy boxes of matches in bulk from Stockholm, which was a few hours away from his small town. He could get the matches for cheap and then sell them individually for a nice profit, but still at a reasonable price.

                            Pretty soon, he was riding around town on his bicycle and selling matches one by one to anyone who needed them.Once the matches began selling well, the young boy expanded his tiny operation. Before long, he added christmas ornaments, fish, seeds, ballpoint pens and pencils. A few years later, he started selling furniture.

                            The young boy’s name was Ingvar Kamprad and when he was seventeen, he decided to name his business. He called it IKEA.

                            In 2013, IKEA made over $37 billion dollars. It’s amazing what you can do with a few matches.</p></span>


                            <h5>Focus on Getting Good, Not Making It Big</h5>
                            <span><p>Ingvar Kamprad focused on getting good at business before he tried to get big at business. Think about that for a moment.

                                Many people (and I’ve been guilty of this as well) want to get big more than they want to become good. The new photographer wants to be published in National Geographic or win that big photo contest, not shoot in relative obscurity while mastering his craft. The new writer wants to hit the best-seller list, not become an expert of prose. The young basketball player wants to be in the starting lineup, not become the best dribbler on the team.

                                But if you only focus on these results, then it can be very easy to get distracted from doing the volume of work required to build the skills you need to succeed. And it’s the volume that matters. The process is more important than the goal. This is especially true in the beginning. Focus on getting good before you worry about getting big.In fact, most of what you create early on — even if it’s good — probably won’t be that good. In a previous article, I shared a research study that analyzed over 70 famous composers and revealed that not a single one of these musical geniuses produced a famous musical piece before year 10 of their career. This period of little recognition and hard work was referred to as the “10 years of silence” and it’s very similar to the period that Ingvar Kamprad spent selling matches. Different industries, same dedication to developing skills. </p></span>

                                <h5>2.Creating a Research Review process.</h5>
                            <p>

                                In 2005, a Stanford professor named John Ioannidis blew the lid off of the academic community when he published a highly regarded paper called Why Most Published Research Findings Are False.

                                Among other problems, Ioannidis' work has revealed that 80 percent of small, non-randomized studies (the majority of research studies) end up being proven wrong at some point in the future. In other words, most of the research findings people are citing today will be false tomorrow.

                                Because I base a lot of my writing and ideas on proven scientific research, I worry a lot about bad science. I want to avoid these errors and I think it is my responsibility to deliver information to you that is based on the best science possible. Here's how I'm doing it:

                                Only 10 to 15 percent of large, randomized trials end up being proven wrong later. In other words, you completely flip the scales in the favor of truth if a study is large and randomized.
                                If a study has been repeated dozens or hundreds of times, then you have a significant trend. For example, when I wrote about implementation intentions, I drew on research from more than 100 studies that all confirmed the same finding.
                                By focusing on scientific research that has been repeated consistently and that is the product of large, randomized trials, I am taking careful steps to only cite research that has a high likelihood of being correct in the long run.

                                Sadly, bad science is often cited on the web. Many authors will see one small-scale study that proves a point, and then cite that research as if it represents the scientific consensus on the topic. It rarely does. In the future, I'll be writing more about how to protect yourself from pseudoscience, bad science, and quackery.

                        <p>There is a famous organ donation study that revealed how multiple European countries skyrocketed their organ donation rates: they required citizens to opt-out of donating rather than opt-in to donating. You can do something similar in your life by opting your future self into better habits ahead of time. For example, you could schedule your yoga session for next week while you are feeling motivated today. When your workout rolls around, you have to justify opting-out rather than motivating yourself to opt-in.</p>

                        <h4>3.Adding a Thank You section at the end of articles.</h4>
                        <p>I have said this many times before, but nearly every idea I write about, I learned from someone else.

                            So I thought, why not thank these people?

                            Now, when you click on the sources section at the bottom of any article and you'll see a line that says “Thanks to…” at the bottom of the article. I figure people should be rewarded for their contribution whenever possible. Plus, it's just good karma to thank the people who help you out.

                            You can see an example at the end of this article:

                        <p>Readers have been asking me to add images to my articles for a while now. I have always wanted to do it, but I couldn't figure out a way to add images that brought more value to the post. (I didn't want to just add stock photos.)

                            Now I have an answer.

                            I have been creating hand-drawn images that visually display the main idea of the article. Not only do the images add more value to the article, I have fun drawing them too.</p>

                    <h4>5.Putting the reader experience above all.</h4>
                    <p>I think a lot about what it would be like to visit JamesClear.com as a first-time reader. Could I find everything easily? Would it be pleasant to read? What parts of the experience would be distracting? Can I eliminate those distracting parts?

                        I want your experience as a reader to be the best possible. For this reason, I have eliminated nearly every annoying part of the reading experience: no advertising, no sidebar, no in-your-face marketing, etc.

                        In my opinion, good design is a way to serve the reader. Most recently, I spent a day optimizing the font sizes, line heights, space between paragraphs, and headings of my articles. I want your experience as a reader to be flawless. It's not perfect yet, but I'm confident that I'll continue to improve the reading experience for you as time goes on.</p>

                        <p>“Lifting weights increases your muscle mass. In the past they used to say that weight lifting caused the “micro-tearing of muscles,” with subsequent healing and increase in size. Today some people discuss hormonal signaling or genes, tomorrow they will discuss something else. But the effect has held forever and will continue to do so.”

                            —Nicholas Nassim Taleb, Antifragile

                            I try my best to write about topics that will stand the test of time. What effects will hold forever? What ideas are actually useful in the long-run?

                            Rather than discuss the latest technology for building habits, I focus on falling in love with boredom and doing the work.
                            Rather than debate the latest workout craze, I focus on the fundamentals of strength training.
                            Rather than worry about a savvy new productivity theory, I talk about a strategy that has worked for decades.</p>

                        <h4>7.Creating a safe space for you to comment and share.</h4>
                        <p>I recently added a subtitle to the comments section: “Share your knowledge and experience.”

                            One of the things I love most about our community is that we have people who help others by sharing their knowledge and experience. For example, when Martin asked for help with quitting his smoking habit, five people jumped in and shared their ideas and experiences.

                            I can't tell you how much I love that. Our community is a family of people from all around the globe and I couldn't be happier to provide a space for us to help one another. In the future, if you have an idea or question, the best place to leave it is in the comments. Not only will I try to help out, but you'll get the collective brain power of our community as well.</p>
