                        <h3>SOME RECOMMENDED AUTHOR'S FOR MUST READ</h4>
                        <span><h6>•J.K.Rowling, Mary GrandPré</h6>
                            <p>
                                To a generation of "Harry Potter" fans, Mary GrandPré is a celebrity.
                                She's famous for illustrating the American editions of J.K. Rowling's book. She designed the covers for all seven of the main books in the series, made the chapter illustrations, and invented the famous lightning bolt-styled logo that's still used today. Her images were the first images people had for what Harry Potter looked like, years before Daniel Radcliffe was on the scene.
                                GrandPré did all that with almost no input from Rowling herself. She told that she didn't even meet or speak to the "Harry Potter" creator until after "Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," the third book in the series, was published in 1999.
                                During the years she worked on the books, GrandPré mostly communicated through Scholastic Creative Director David Saylor.

                            <h6>•Suzanne Collins</h6>
                            <p>Suzanne Collins has had a successful and prolific career writing for children's television. She has worked on the staffs of several Nickelodeon shows, including the Emmy-nominated hit Clarissa Explains It All and The Mystery Files of Shelby Woo. Collins made her mark in children's literature with the New York Times bestselling five-book series for middle-grade readers The Underland Chronicles, which has received numerous accolades in both the United States and abroad. In the award-winning The Hunger Games trilogy, Collins continues to explore the effects of war and violence on those coming of age. Collins lives with her family in Connecticut.</p>
                            <h6>•Stephenie Meyer</h6>
                            <p>Stephenie Meyer is best known for authoring the best-selling 'Twilight' book series, which was adapted into a hit film franchise.
                                Stephenie Meyer is the best-selling author of the Twilight book series. Inspired by a dream, she wrote the first book and attracted the attention of agent Jodi Reamer, who secured her a three-book publishing deal. The books have sold more than 250 million copies, been translated into 37 languages and adapted for a five-part hit film series. Meyer has also published the novels The Host (2008) and The Chemist (2016) and launched her own film production company.

                            <h6>•Khaled Hosseini</h6>
                            <p>Hosseini grew up in Kabul; his father was a diplomat and his mother a secondary-school teacher. In 1976 he and his parents moved to Paris, where his father worked at the Afghan embassy. With the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979, they found returning to their home impossible, and they moved to California, having been granted political asylum by the United States. Hosseini attended Santa Clara University, where he studied biology, and in 1989 he began attending medical school at the University of California, San Diego. He entered private practice as an internist in 1996, three years after receiving his medical degree.

                                Hosseini began working in 2001 on The Kite Runner, writing at 4:00 AM before heading to his medical practice. The novel’s narrator is Amir, a writer who lives in California in the present day but who grew up in the 1970s in Kabul, the privileged son of a wealthy family. Amir’s story centres on his childhood friendship with Hassan, the son of a family servant, and its subsequent dissolution. The Kite Runner was praised for its powerful storytelling, but it was, at times, dismissed by critics for elements considered melodramatic. Nonetheless, the novel soon gained wide popularity through readers’ word-of-mouth praise, and it was eventually published in more than three dozen countries; a film adaptation was released in 2007. Prompted by this success, Hosseini turned to writing full-time in 2004. The focus brought by the novel to the continuing Afghan refugee crisis led to his appointment as a goodwill envoy for the UN High Commissioner for Refugees in 2006.</p>
